# interactiveSorter-Counter
a front-end-based app that implements basics html, css &amp; js to make an interactive number sorter/counter.

I wanted to test how dom API works and this was perfect for my first idea since it uses various intertwined concepts. Feel free to add numbers from the bottom right, use incrementors/decrementors with each box or edit them with double clicking.
